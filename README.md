## Streams UI

The user's interface, including a control panel, is an optional core component of the Streams platform. Streams UI extends the [stream domain information](https://streams.dev/docs/streams#domain-information).

### Input Types

Input types separate the concerns of [data-modeling](https://streams.dev/docs/streams#domain-entities) vs. data-management and provides a refreshing new layer of flexibility.

### UI Components

Several flexible UI components are available and can be used both within and outside of a control panel. We use a factory-like `builder` pattern and utilize [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.com/) to provide versatile and fast UI features.

### Control Panel

The Streams platform provides a consistent, user-friendly, and fast control panel that puts you in control of every aspect. Zero configuration is necessary by default.
